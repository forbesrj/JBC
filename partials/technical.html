<p>
    The foundation of a great a web application is the technology behind it.
Keeping <b>up-to-date</b> with the latest programming languages, frameworks, design patterns,
testing methods, and other trends are all a part of that <b>foundation</b>.
    Up-to-date coding strategies not only allow the a site to incorporate great features,
    they allow <b>search engine optimization, responsiveness,</b> and <b>adaptability</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Another important factor is a <b>diverse toolkit</b>.
    Every project is different and it is a developer's responsibility to ensure
    that the <b>tool fits the job</b>, not that the job fits the tool. Just Better Code
    determines the tools based on what best fits the project requirements, even
    if that means that a new tool needs to be learned.
